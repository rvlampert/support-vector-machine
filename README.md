# SVM - Suport-vector machines

In machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks[1]) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.

## Objective

Train a machine learning model capable of classifying whether the individual cancer is malignant or benign using SVM.

## Dataset

This is a famous dataset where the features correspond to physical information about the patient's breast cells and the label correpond if the cancer is malignant or benign.

## How to run

Create a virtual environment, use ```make install-dependencies``` command to install the python dependencies, then use ```make run``` to run the program
